There are 2 different ways:

Option A - Through console

1) Start the game
2) Open console by pressing Shift and Tidle (the key under ESC) keys
3) Write the following

seta r_customwidth (your resolution width, for example 1920)
seta r_customheight (your resolution height, for example 1080)
seta r_mode -1
vid_restart

4) Done.

Option B - Through an "autoexec" file

1) Go to the game's folder (Default is C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Jedi Academy)
2) Go to GameData and open Base
3) Create a new text file
4) Open the new text file and write the above commands (seta r_customwidth, height etc.)
5) Save the file as "autoexec.cfg", not "autoexec.txt"
6) Done - the file will run automatically every time you start the game
